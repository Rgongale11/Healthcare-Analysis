 Project Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to design and implement an interactive Power BI dashboard for the analysis of patient waiting lists in healthcare systems. 
	The dashboard aims to monitor and evaluate the current status of patient waiting times, analyze historical trends, and break down the waiting list by specialties,
	 demographics, and other key metrics. This tool will provide healthcare stakeholders with actionable insights, enabling informed decision-making to enhance patient care 
	and resource management.

Insights:

- **Trend Analysis**: By analyzing historical data from 2018 to 2021, the dashboard identifies trends in waiting times, helping to determine whether waiting lists are improving or 
	worsening over time.

- **Specialty and Demographic Breakdown**: The dashboard provides detailed insights into waiting lists based on specialties, patient age groups, and time periods, highlighting 
	areas with the most significant waiting time challenges.

- **Real-Time Data**: With Power BI’s real-time data capabilities, stakeholders can monitor the latest data, including the current month’s patient waiting list, facilitating timely
	 interventions.

- **Customizable View**: The interactive features of the dashboard, including slicers for Archive Date, Case Type, and Specialty, allow users to filter data and focus on specific
	 subsets, such as inpatient vs. outpatient categories or age-based waiting lists.

- **Data Quality Management**: Data cleansing and transformation processes ensure that the information presented is accurate and reliable, such as renaming columns,
	 removing duplicates, and trimming values to maintain high data quality.

Recommendations:

- **Expand Data Granularity**: Including geographic data (e.g., by region or hospital) can further enhance the analysis by highlighting specific areas with significant waiting time issues.

- **Incorporate Predictive Analytics**: Integrating predictive models, such as forecasting waiting times, could provide valuable insights for resource planning and patient flow management.

- **Broaden Key Metrics**: Adding additional KPIs, such as patient satisfaction, staff workload, and discharge rates, can give a more comprehensive view of healthcare performance.

- **Enhance Usability**: To make the dashboard more accessible to non-technical users, implementing simple tooltips, annotations, and guided explanations would improve user experience.

- **Automate Data Refresh**: Automating the data refresh process will ensure the dashboard reflects real-time data with minimal manual input, enhancing its effectiveness as a
	 decision-making tool.

 Conclusion:

This Power BI dashboard serves as a valuable tool for tracking and analyzing patient waiting lists, offering deep insights into healthcare system performance. 
It enables stakeholders to make data-driven decisions based on real-time and historical data. Although the current dashboard provides essential information,
 there is potential for improvement by adding more granular data, predictive features, and additional KPIs. By implementing these enhancements, the dashboard 
will become an even more powerful tool for optimizing healthcare resource allocation, improving patient care, and streamlining operational efficiency. 
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of Power BI in transforming healthcare data into actionable intelligence, helping institutions better manage patient waiting lists
 and operational workflows.
